What do you think about the time complexity of this algorithm?

for i = 0 to N
    for j = 0 to M
        print(i)








//ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(N * M)
Explanation:
Outer loop runs for N iterations, and for each iteration of the outer loop the inner loop again runs for M iterations.

Total operations => N * M * O(1) => O(N * M)

We cannot ignore any of N or M as both are variable.
