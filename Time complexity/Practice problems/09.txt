Multiple Choice Question
What is the time complexity of this code?

function f(a):
    if a == 0:
        return 9
    else:
        return f(a - 1)

print(f(n))









//ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(n)
Explanation:
For any value of *a* greater than 0, the function is calling itself again. Thus the total function calls will be O(a) which is O(n)
