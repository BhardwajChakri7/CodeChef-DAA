Increment by 2, nested loops
What is the time complexity of this code?

i = 1
while (i < n)
	i = i + 2
	j = 1
	while (j < m)
		j = j + 1
		print(i + j)





Correct Answer:

O(nm)
Explanation:
The outer loop is running n / 2 times and the inner loop is running m times. Overall time complexity is O(n * m). Ignoring constants, of course.
