Both Square root and Log
What is the time complexity of this code?

i = 1
while i * i <= n:
    print(i)
    i += 1

i = 1
while i <= n:
    print(i)
    i *= 2










//ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(sqrt(n))
Explanation:
Among sqrt(n) and log(n), sqrt(n) is the bigger factor. That's why is it considered in the final time complexity.
