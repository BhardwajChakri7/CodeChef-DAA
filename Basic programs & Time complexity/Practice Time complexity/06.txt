Multiple Choice Question
What is the time complexity of this code?

while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n //= 3









//ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(log(n))
Explanation:
We already learned that the multiplier doesn't really matter as long as it is a small constant. The time complexity will still be log(n).
