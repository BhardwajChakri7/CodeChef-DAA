Finding time complexity - O(N)
Let's look at another algorithm now.

for i = 0 to N
    print(i)
In the above algorithm, we are running a loop from 0 to N. In total the loop will run N times. For each iteration of the loop we are doing one operation `print(i).

The final time complexity will be: N * O(1) => O(N).

This time the algorithm dependent on a variable N and with that the time complexity also has the value N.

Task
What if we were doing two operations inside the loop?

for i = 0 to N
    print(i)
    print(i * 2)







// ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(N)
