Two loops, three variables
What is the time complexity of this code?

for i = 1 to n
	for j = 1 to m
		print(i + j)

	for l = 1 to k
		print(i + l)









//Answer
Correct Answer:

O(nm+nk)
Explanation:
The outer loop is running n times. And the inner loops are running (m + k) times. We need to keep m and k in the final complexity as they are both variables. Thus final time complexity is O(n * (m + k))
