Multiple Choice Question
What is the time complexity of this code?

s = 0
for i = 1 to n:
    s += i

for j = 1 to s:
    print(j)









//ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(n^2)
Explanation:
The formula for sum of numbers from 1 to n is (n * (n + 1) / 2).

That makes s equivalent to n ^ 2. Thus the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n ^ 2).
