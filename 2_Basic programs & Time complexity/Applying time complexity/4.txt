Time complexity for DSA
Let's go through some examples to understand how to use time complexity for programming problems.

Say you calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N using the following algorithm

sum = 0
for i = 1 to N
    sum += i
print(sum)
and the constraints on N are:
1

ùëÅ
‚â§
100
1‚â§N‚â§100

Will the above algorithm run within 1 second?










//ANSWER
Correct Answer:

Yes
Explanation:
The time complexity of the given algorithm is O(N), which is N operations for any input N.

When N can be at most 100, the total operations will also be 100. This can easily run within a second as the most computers support upto 10 ^ 8 operations or 100 million operations within a second.
