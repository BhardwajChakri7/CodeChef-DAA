Multiple Choice Question
What is the time complexity of this code?

while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n //= 2










//ANSWER

Correct Answer:

O(log(n))
Explanation:
The number of operations in this algorithm is equivalent to:

i = 1
while i <= n:
    i = i * 2


Either you double i each time or half n, you get the same number of operations: log(n).
