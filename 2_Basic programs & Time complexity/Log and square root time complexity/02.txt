Two loops, single variable
What is the time complexity of this code?

for i = 1 to n
	for j = 1 to n / 2
		print(i + j)








//ANSWER
Correct Answer:

O(n^2)
Explanation:
The outer loop runs till n and and the inner loop runs till n / 2. Total operations are thus: (n * n) / 2. But as we can ignore constants when calculating time complexity, the final complexity will be O(n ^ 2).
